## Description
This project focuses on building and maintaining a data-driven dashboard for Satisfeed, a food bank that serves up to 56,000 families. The primary goals are to keep the dashboard updated weekly to accurately reflect the number of people served and to collect and analyze demographic data to generate meaningful statistics that support planning, reporting, and decision-making. We will use Next, Firebase, and Python to enable reliable data management, insightful analytics, and clear visualization of the food bank’s reach and effectiveness.
